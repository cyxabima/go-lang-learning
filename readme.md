# GO Lang Learning Journey

> *“A language that doesn’t change the way you think about programming is not worth knowing.”*

I’ve been formally studying **Computing** at university for about **1.5 years** now. During this time, most of my hands-on work revolved around **loosely typed, interpreted languages** — primarily **Python** and **JavaScript** (including **TypeScript**).

But deep down, I wanted to experience a language that is:

* **Compiled**
* **Statically typed**
* **Modern**
* **Simple, yet powerful**

That curiosity kept pointing me toward **Go (Golang)** — the programming language developed at **Google**, and the language behind **Docker, Kubernetes, and many cloud-native technologies**.

At first, Go sounded impressive because of its ecosystem.
But what truly convinced me was learning *who created it*.

One of Go’s creators is **Ken Thompson**.

If you don’t know Ken Thompson:

* He created **B**, which directly led to **C**
* He co-created **UNIX** (first in Assembly, later rewritten in C)
* He is one of the fathers of **UTF-8 encoding**

As a **Computer Systems Engineering student**, that was enough for me.
I *had* to try Go.

### My Go Journey 🚀

In my **3rd semester**, I took the initiative to seriously learn **Go** — and it turned out to be a **wonderful experience**. I learned a lot, not just syntax, but *how to think differently*.

What I loved most about Go:

* An **excellent standard library**
* **Dependency management** using remote GitHub/module URLs
* **Errors as values** (no try/catch blocks)
* **Pointers**, but *no pointer arithmetic* (safe by design)
* **Concurrency** with goroutines, channels, and `WaitGroup`
  (still exploring this deeply)
* **Garbage collection**, no manual memory handling

Compared to C++, Go feels **simple to the point that it almost feels like cheating** — but in a good way.

I’ve also built a **small RSS Aggregator** as part of this journey, and I’ll be sharing more details about that project very soon.

This is just the beginning, but Go has already changed how I think about **systems, concurrency, and simplicity in software design**.
